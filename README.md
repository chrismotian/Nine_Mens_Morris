# [Nine Mens Morris (in German MÃ¼hle)](https://chrismotian.github.io/nineMensMorris/)

A common board game programmed to sharp my skill in programming, software design, JavaScript and making gamemusic.

First approach was to create it object-oriented, but game logic finaly isn't because I decided that it's smarter to use an adjacent matrix to implement the connections.

I'm using the library [Fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com/)
